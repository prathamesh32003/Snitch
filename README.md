Snitch Systemfetch
</h1>

## What is Snitch:
I personally wanted to create a fetch tool and I also wanted to create a project in C++, so I combined these together and **BOOM!** Snitch was born!

## Dependancies:
`make` and `cmake`for compilation
`vulkaninfo` for running


## How to run:
Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/prathamesh32003/Snitch
   
Change into repo directory:

    cd Snitch

Make a build directory:

    mkdir build/ && cd build/

Compile the program:

    cmake .. && make

Run the program:

    ./fetch

**VERY VERY IMPORTANT:** If you haven't realized by reading the code, I'm a very noobish coder and it's very possible that there are better ways to write this software. So, if you want to actually suggest them, you can open an issue, I'm always eager to learn new things!

# CREDITS:
This project was mostly inspired by [Catnap.](https://github.com/iinsertNameHere/catnap) I decided to make this because Catnap did not fetch multi-gpus and I wanted to write an actual project is C++ and not just LeetCodes. I also took all of the ascii arts for distros from this repository because I was too tired to make mine.
